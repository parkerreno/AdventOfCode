# AdventOfCode
My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.  You shouldn't look at these before you've solved the puzzles yourself; 
I won't post until the leaderboard is full of people who have solved the puzzle (which almost certainly before I've solved it myself).  Please don't judge my code too hard 😅.

## Helpful Hints
Some helpful hints from places I've gotten stuck:
 - D1P2: [this is more prompt interpretation help] eightwothree should be parsed at 823, not 8wo3 or eigh23
